/**
 * `EmailField` — an email address (docs/design-system.md §5.8).
 *
 * A `TextField` with the six attributes an email input needs and one behaviour it needs: the
 * tidy-up on blur. Worth a component rather than a convention because those attributes are wrong
 * on at least one screen every time they are retyped — `autoCapitalize` is the one everyone
 * forgets, and on iOS it capitalises the first letter of an address that is then rejected by a
 * case-sensitive local part.
 *
 * **It reports a value, not an event** — the same shape as `Select` and `SearchSelect`. A control
 * that rewrites what was typed has to own the value, and one that owns the value has no business
 * handing back an event whose `target.value` is already stale.
 *
 * It does **not** decide whether the address is valid. `isEmailLike` is exported so the caller's
 * form validation and this field agree on the rule, and the real answer comes from the server and
 * from the verification mail actually arriving.

 *
 * Every rule here is something a paste actually contains: `Ada Lovelace <ada@example.com>` from a
 * mail client, a `mailto:` from a copied link, a trailing space from a spreadsheet cell.
 *
 * The domain is lowercased and **the local part is not**: domains are case-insensitive (RFC 1035)
 * while local parts are formally case-*sensitive*. Lowercasing the whole address is what most
 * providers do in practice, and doing it here would silently rewrite an address for the minority
 * of servers that honour the spec.

 * here is a customer who cannot be invited; the failure mode of being loose is a verification
 * mail that bounces, which the system already handles.
