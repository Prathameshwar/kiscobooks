 * total and no way to name the rest (docs/api-conventions.md §2.1). And it would be assembled from

 * and reports too (CLAUDE.md §6.15, docs/field-permissions.md §6) — only the server can hold that
 * line. So the component reports the request and the format; the screen calls the endpoint, which
 * runs the job, applies field policy, audits it and hands back a signed, expiring URL (§5.14).

 * that they are not going to get.
