/**
 * The console shell: one grid, one scroll container (design-system §4.1).
 *
 *   columns  rail | content        rows  top bar | main
 *   the rail spans both rows, so the lockup sits in the top bar's band
 *   `main` is the only `overflow-y:auto`, so the rail and top bar never move
 *
 * Below the drawer breakpoint the rail leaves the grid and becomes an off-canvas drawer.
 * That state is the shell's own, because "is the drawer showing" is transient. `collapsed`
 * belongs to the caller instead: it is a preference about how the person likes to work, so the
 * app decides whether to remember it and where.
 *
 * Today the console keeps it in component state, which means it resets on reload. Persisting it
 * needs the same pre-paint treatment as the theme — read before the first frame, or the rail
 * renders at 288px and snaps to 72px after hydration, which looks like a bug rather than a
 * restored preference.
