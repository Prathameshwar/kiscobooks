 * `PasswordField` — a password, with a strength meter that means something (docs/design-system.md §5.10).
 *
 * Three things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **It never blocks paste.** Blocking paste is how a password manager gets defeated, which trades
 *   a theoretical shoulder-surfing risk for the certainty of weaker, reused, hand-typed passwords.
 * - **It never sends the password anywhere to be scored.** The assessment is local and cheap; a
 *   "check this against breach lists" call belongs on the server, over the hash prefix, not here.
 * - **It is not the policy.** The meter advises; the server decides. Scoring in the browser is
 *   advice a hostile client can simply not run.

 * | Under the supplied minimum (default 8) | 0 — nothing else is considered |
 * | Accepted, but under 8 characters | 1, "Weak"; recommend a longer password |
 * | Contains something from `avoid` (4+ characters) | 0, "Too guessable" |
 * | One character or one straight run | capped at 1 |
 * | Lower **and** upper case · a digit · a symbol · 16+ characters | +1 each, capped at 4 |
 *
 * The length bonus is what stops a long passphrase — the strongest thing most people will type —
 * from scoring below a short `P@ss1` that ticks every character-class box.
 *
 * `avoid` catches the reuse the caller can actually see: the email address and name being typed
 * into the same form. A four-character floor keeps it from matching an initial or a `.com`.
