/**
 * `PhoneField` — a dial code and a national number (docs/design-system.md §5.9).
 *
 * **Two values, because the schema stores two.** `phone_country_code VARCHAR(8)` and
 * `phone VARCHAR(20)` are separate columns in [identity-schema](../../../../docs/identity-schema.md);
 * a control that reported one `+919876543210` string would force every caller to split it again,
 * and they would each split it differently. `toE164` is exported for the transports that genuinely
 * need one string — SMS and WhatsApp delivery ([notification](../../../../docs/notification.md)).
 *
 * **The dial codes are a prop, not a table in here.** `country.phone_prefix` is the platform's one
 * source for them; a list baked into the design system would be a second source, and the second
 * source is always the stale one.
 *
 * It does not pretty-print as you type. Digit grouping is per-country data (and per-length within
 * a country), so formatting without that data produces confident nonsense — `+91 987 654 3210` for
 * a number Indians read as `98765 43210`. Storing and showing the digits the user typed is honest;
 * the server, which has the country data, is what validates.
