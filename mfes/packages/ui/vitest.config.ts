 * @janso/ui tests its own primitives, rather than leaning on a consuming app to do it.
 * Tests import from source module paths (`../src/components/Card`) so a package with a
 * half-written barrel file still tests cleanly.
 *
 * The theme system tests (`tests/themes.test.ts`) read the stylesheets as text, so they
 * need no CSS pipeline; components style via class names, hence `css: false`.
